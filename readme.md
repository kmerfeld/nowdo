nowdo is a simple application to remind me what im supposed to be working on.

It will read ~/todo.md every ten minutes and notify you what the top item there is.

~/todo.md should be in the following format

```
#this is a task's title
This is a description of the task
it can have as many lines as you want.

#task2
This wont be shown by nowdo until you open
~/todo.md and remove the first task

#buy milk
im almost out
```
